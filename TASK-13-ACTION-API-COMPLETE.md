# Task 13: Actions API Implementation Completed

## Scope
- Allow users to trigger simulated AI-recommended actions

## Implementation Summary
The `/api/task/{taskId}/action` endpoint has been successfully implemented along with frontend components for displaying and executing actions suggested by the AI assistant. This feature enables the AI to recommend specific actions to users and allows users to execute these actions with a single click.

## Components Implemented

### Backend
- **Action Service**: Enhanced `action_service.py` to handle various action types and connect with Azure Functions
- **API Endpoint**: Implemented `/api/task/{taskId}/action` endpoint in `actions.py`
- **AI Integration**: Updated `text_utils.py` to extract action suggestions from AI responses

### Frontend
- **ActionButtons Component**: Created a reusable component for displaying and executing actions
- **ChatWidget Component**: Built a full-featured chat interface with AI interaction
- **Task Detail Page**: Implemented a page to display task details and host the chat interface
- **API Clients**: Added clients for chat, actions, and tasks to communicate with the backend

### Azure Functions
- Updated the `generateMissingInfoLetter` function to use consistent parameters from the action service

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to the Task Detail page for any task
2. Ask a question that would likely result in a recommended action (e.g., "What information is missing for this filing?")
3. The AI should respond with an answer and a suggested action
4. Click the action button
5. The system should call the appropriate Azure Function and display the result

## Supported Actions
The following actions are now supported:
- Generate Missing Information Letter
- Trigger Risk Review
- Generate Client Summary
- Send to Tax Review

## Notes
- For prototype purposes, all actions are available for all tasks. In a production system, available actions would be filtered based on task type, status, and user role.
- Mock data is used for action parameters that would normally be extracted from AI responses.
- Document generation relies on Azure Blob Storage for file hosting.
