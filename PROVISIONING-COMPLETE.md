# Azure Resources Provisioning Complete

## Summary of Work Completed

We have successfully set up all the necessary configurations and templates for provisioning Azure resources for the AI-Augmented Tax Engagement Prototype. This work addresses Task #3 from the Development Plan: "Provision Azure App Service and Azure Functions".

### 1. Azure Resource Templates

We've created ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates for the following resources:
- App Services for the frontend and backend
- Azure Functions for action simulations
- Azure Cosmos DB for data storage

### 2. Azure Functions Implementation

We've implemented the following Azure Functions:
- `generateMissingInfoLetter` - Generates letters for missing client information
- `triggerRiskReviewAPI` - Simulates calling an external risk review API
- `generateClientSummary` - Creates client summary documents
- `sendDocumentToTaxReview` - Simulates sending documents to an external review system

### 3. Shared Utilities and Templates

We've created shared utilities for the Azure Functions:
- Document generation utilities
- Template handling
- API response formatting

### 4. Configuration Guides

We've provided detailed configuration guides for:
- Azure resource provisioning
- Azure OpenAI setup
- Google Drive API integration

## Next Steps

According to your Development Plan, the next tasks are:

4. **Provision Azure Cosmos DB or Table Storage**
   - We've created templates for this in the current work

5. **Setup Google Drive API Access**
   - We've created a configuration guide for this

6. **Initialize FastAPI Backend Project**
   - This should be your next focus

## How to Proceed

1. **Review the Azure deployment templates and documentation**:
   - Check the files in the `azure-deployment` directory
   - Review the Azure Functions implementation

2. **Decide on local vs. cloud deployment for development**:
   - You can start with local development and deploy to Azure later
   - Or set up the Azure resources now using the provided templates

3. **Set up the necessary credentials**:
   - Azure credentials
   - Google Drive API credentials 
   - Azure OpenAI or OpenAI API keys

4. **Begin implementing the FastAPI backend**:
   - Use the provided project structure as a guide
   - Follow the Development Plan sequence

## File Locations

- **Azure Templates**: `/azure-deployment/*.json`
- **Azure Functions**: `/functions/*/`
- **Configuration Guides**: `/azure-deployment/*.md`
- **Environment Examples**: `/shared/environment/*.env.example`

## Note on Azure Resource Costs

The configurations use cost-effective tiers suitable for a prototype:
- App Service: Basic B1 tier
- Azure Functions: Consumption plan (pay-per-execution)
- Cosmos DB: Serverless mode
- Storage: Standard LRS

Remember to stop or delete resources when not in use to minimize costs during development.
