# Task 9: Projects API Implementation Complete

The `/api/projects` endpoint has been successfully implemented, enabling the following functionality:

## Features Implemented

- **GET /api/projects**: Retrieves all available projects from the database
- **GET /api/projects/{project_id}**: Retrieves a specific project by ID
- **POST /api/projects**: Creates a new project
- **PUT /api/projects/{project_id}**: Updates an existing project
- **DELETE /api/projects/{project_id}**: Deletes a project

## Implementation Details

1. Added `get_all_projects()` and `get_project_by_id()` methods to the `ProjectService` class
2. Implemented the projects API endpoints in the `projects.py` router
3. Added comprehensive error handling and logging
4. Created sample projects initialization logic
5. Updated the FastAPI startup event to initialize sample projects
6. Created a test script to verify the API works correctly

## Testing

A test script has been provided at `backend/scripts/test_projects_api.sh` that can be run to verify the projects API functionality. The script performs the following:

1. Logs in to get an authentication token
2. Lists all projects
3. Gets a specific project
4. Creates a new project
5. Updates an existing project
6. (Optionally) Deletes a project

## Next Steps

Move on to implementing the tasks API endpoints to enable managing tasks associated with projects.
