# Google Drive API Integration Report

## Task Completed
The Google Drive API integration for the AI Tax Prototype has been successfully set up. This integration allows the application to store and retrieve documents from Google Drive, organized by project and document type.

## Configuration Details

### Google Cloud Project
- **Project Name**: AI Tax Prototype
- **Project ID**: ai-tax-prototype
- **Project Number**: 435764122219

### Service Account
- **Name**: ai-tax-prototype-service
- **Email**: ai-tax-prototype-service@ai-tax-prototype.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- **Key**: JSON key stored in environment variable

### Google Drive Folder Structure
- **Root Folder**: "AI Tax Prototype" (ID: 1Sgu7x72uwZOlDjb5V_27Nz-Ukdi0Jtin)
- **Projects Folder**: (ID: 1AsW0b_yHah1A9l5iayv_jEex-I-hO3KR)
- **FormTemplates Folder**: (ID: 1hP3ihKH6h_qcmU3KRbmFl1l493Kk1AjW)

## Implementation Details

The following files have been created or modified:

1. **Backend Configuration**:
   - Updated `backend/.env` with Google Drive credentials and folder IDs
   - Modified `backend/app/core/config.py` to support new configuration options

2. **Google Drive Client**:
   - Enhanced `backend/app/core/drive_client.py` to support project folders and templates
   - Added functions for listing projects, files, and templates

3. **Setup Script**:
   - Created `backend/scripts/setup_drive.py` to initialize and verify Google Drive structure
   - Added functionality to upload sample files to the appropriate folders

4. **Sample Files**:
   - Added sample templates in `shared/samples/templates/`
   - Added sample project files in `shared/samples/projects/Project-001/`

5. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/google_drive_setup.md`
   - Added task completion report in `TASK-5-GOOGLE-DRIVE-COMPLETE.md`

## How to Use the Google Drive Integration

### In Backend Services

```python
from app.core.drive_client import drive_client

# List all project folders
project_folders = drive_client.list_project_folders()

# Get a specific project folder
project_folder = drive_client.get_folder_by_project_id("001")

# List files in a project folder
files = drive_client.list_files_in_folder(project_folder["id"])

# Get content of a file
content = drive_client.get_file_content(file_id)

# Upload a file to a project folder
drive_client.upload_file("document.pdf", document_content, project_folder["id"])

# List available form templates
templates = drive_client.list_form_templates()
```

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Copy the service account JSON key to your `.env` file
   - Set the folder IDs in your `.env` file

2. **Initialize the Folder Structure**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python scripts/setup_drive.py
   ```

3. **Verify Setup in Google Drive**:
   - Check that project folders and sample files are visible in your Google Drive

## Security Considerations

1. The service account key should be kept secure and not committed to version control
2. In a production environment, consider using more restricted IAM roles
3. For development, we're using the full service account key in the environment variables
4. In production, consider using managed identity or a key vault service

## Next Steps

With the Google Drive API integration complete, the development team can now proceed to the next tasks:

1. Implement the backend document service that uses this integration
2. Connect the document service to the AI context assembly process
3. Implement the frontend document viewer and uploader
