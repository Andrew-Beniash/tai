# Task 8: Login Endpoint Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview

The login endpoint implementation has been completed successfully. This task involved:

1. Implementing a login endpoint in the backend API
2. Creating a login page in the frontend
3. Setting up authentication context and protected routes
4. Implementing session management using localStorage

## Implementation Details

### Backend

- Created `/api/login` endpoint that authenticates users and returns JWT tokens
- Implemented `/api/users/me` endpoint to get current user information
- Added a test endpoint `/api/login-test` for verifying authentication configuration
- Configured hardcoded users (Jeff and Hanna) for the prototype

### Frontend

- Created an authentication API client for interacting with the backend
- Implemented an authentication context provider for managing auth state
- Built a login page with form and quick login buttons
- Set up protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users
- Added session management utilities for localStorage

## Testing

To test the login functionality:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Start the frontend server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to the login page and use one of the following credentials:
   - Username: "jeff", Password: "password"
   - Username: "hanna", Password: "password"

## Next Steps

The next tasks in the development plan are:

- Task 9: Implement `/api/projects` Endpoint
- Task 10: Implement `/api/tasks` Endpoint
- Task 11: Implement `/api/task/{taskId}` Endpoint
