# Task 5: Google Drive API Access - COMPLETE

This task involved setting up Google Drive API access for the AI Tax Prototype project. The following items have been completed:

## 1. Google Cloud Project Setup
- Project created: "AI Tax Prototype"
- Project ID: ai-tax-prototype
- Project Number: 435764122219
- Google Drive API enabled

## 2. Service Account Configuration
- Service account created: ai-tax-prototype-service
- Service account email: ai-tax-prototype-service@ai-tax-prototype.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- Service account key JSON file provided and configured

## 3. Google Drive Folder Structure
- Root folder: "AI Tax Prototype" (ID: 1Sgu7x72uwZOlDjb5V_27Nz-Ukdi0Jtin)
- Projects folder: (ID: 1AsW0b_yHah1A9l5iayv_jEex-I-hO3KR)
- FormTemplates folder: (ID: 1hP3ihKH6h_qcmU3KRbmFl1l493Kk1AjW)

## 4. Code Implementations
- Updated `backend/app/core/drive_client.py` to support folder structure and template access
- Modified `backend/app/core/config.py` to include new configuration options
- Created `backend/scripts/setup_drive.py` to initialize and validate the folder structure
- Created sample templates and files in `shared/samples/`

## 5. Documentation
- Added detailed Google Drive setup documentation in `docs/google_drive_setup.md`
- Updated backend `.env` file with necessary configuration

## How to Test
1. Ensure the backend `.env` file is properly configured with Google credentials
2. Run the setup script:
   ```
   cd backend
   python scripts/setup_drive.py
   ```
3. Verify in Google Drive that project folders and sample documents have been created

## Next Steps
The next task in the development plan is:
- Task 6: Initialize FastAPI Backend Project

## Notes
- For security, the Google service account key is stored as an environment variable instead of a file
- The service account has been granted access to the necessary folders in Google Drive
- Sample document templates have been provided for Form 1120, Form 1065, and Missing Information letters
