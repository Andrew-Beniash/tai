# Task List Screen Implementation

## Task Completed
**Develop Task List Screen (Filtered by User)** - Show tasks for selected project and current user.

## Implementation Summary
The Task List screen has been implemented to show all tasks for a selected project that are assigned to the current logged-in user. The implementation includes:

1. A `TasksPage.tsx` component that:
   - Fetches tasks for a selected project from the API
   - Filters tasks assigned to the current user
   - Displays project information and task list
   - Shows an information banner indicating how many tasks are assigned to the current user
   - Provides navigation back to the Projects page

2. A `TaskList.tsx` component that:
   - Displays a table with task details including client, form, status, priority, and due date
   - Shows appropriate visual indicators for task status and priority (color-coded badges)
   - Provides a clean empty state when no tasks are assigned
   - Includes a loading state while tasks are being fetched
   - Links to the detailed view of each task

## User Experience
1. User selects a project from the Projects page
2. They are navigated to the Tasks page with the project ID as a query parameter
3. The page fetches all tasks for the project, then filters to show only those assigned to the current user
4. The user can see task information in a table format with color-coded status and priority
5. The user can click on a task to view its details

## Technical Details
- Tasks are filtered on the client side after fetching all tasks for the project
- The task list shows tasks for the current user only (Jeff or Hanna)
- The UI components are built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS
- The empty state provides clear feedback when a user has no assigned tasks

## Testing Instructions
1. Log in as either Jeff (Preparer) or Hanna (Reviewer)
2. Navigate to the Projects page and select a project
3. Verify that only tasks assigned to the current user are displayed
4. Log out and switch users to verify that different users see different tasks
5. Test with projects that have no tasks for the current user to verify the empty state

## Implementation Notes
- The task filtering is done client-side but could be moved to the API in a production environment for better performance with large datasets
- Added a user-specific message showing how many tasks are displayed vs. total tasks
- Enhanced the empty state with a more user-friendly message when no tasks are assigned
