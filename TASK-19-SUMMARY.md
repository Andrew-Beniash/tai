# Task 19: Send Document to Tax Review - Summary

## Task Overview

As part of the AI-Augmented Tax Engagement Prototype, we've implemented an Azure Function that simulates sending documents to an external tax review system. This function is Task 19 in our development plan.

## Implementation Status

The `sendDocumentToTaxReview` function has been successfully implemented and includes:

1. An HTTP-triggered Azure Function that accepts POST requests
2. Request parameter validation for required fields
3. Mock response generation with tracking IDs
4. Error handling for various scenarios
5. Integration with the backend action service

## Technical Details

- **File Structure**:
  - `/functions/sendDocumentToTaxReview/__init__.py`: Main function logic
  - `/functions/sendDocumentToTaxReview/function.json`: Function configuration

- **Environment Variables**:
  - `MOCK_TAX_REVIEW_SYSTEM_URL`: URL of the mock tax review system

- **Integration Points**:
  - Backend's action_service.py calls this function when a user triggers the "Send to Tax Review" action
  - The function returns a tracking ID which could be used for status checking

## Function Flow

1. Function receives a POST request with taskId, clientName, documentUrl, and reviewNotes
2. Validates the required parameters
3. Generates a tracking ID using the format `TAXREV-{taskId}-{timestamp}`
4. Simulates sending the document to the external tax review system
5. Returns a success response with tracking ID and mock data

## Documentation Created

- `TASK-19-SEND-TO-TAX-REVIEW-COMPLETE.md`: Implementation details and completion
- `TASK-19-TESTING-INSTRUCTIONS.md`: Testing guidelines for validation

## Next Steps

This Azure Function completes the requirements for Task 19. The function is now ready to be:

1. Tested through the backend API integration
2. Triggered from the frontend UI when users select the "Send to Tax Review" action
3. Deployed to Azure via the CI/CD pipeline

The function is set up to follow the same pattern as other action functions in the prototype, maintaining consistency in code structure and behavior.

This implementation supports the project's goal of demonstrating AI-driven assistance in tax workflows, particularly the ability to recommend and execute actions based on AI chat interactions.
