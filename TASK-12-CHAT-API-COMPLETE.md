# Task 12 - Chat API Implementation Complete

The `/api/task/{taskId}/chat` endpoint has been successfully implemented. This endpoint accepts user questions and calls the OpenAI API with contextual document and task data to generate helpful responses.

## Key Features Implemented

- POST endpoint for sending user messages to the AI
- GET endpoint for retrieving preset questions for tasks
- Context-aware prompt building using task metadata and document content
- Document text extraction (simulated with predefined content for prototype)
- Action suggestion extraction from AI responses
- Comprehensive error handling

## Components Updated

1. **API Module**:
   - Enhanced `chat.py` with endpoints for chat and preset questions

2. **Services**:
   - Updated `ai_service.py` to process chat messages with OpenAI
   - Updated `openai_client.py` to use the latest OpenAI API

3. **Utilities**:
   - Enhanced `prompt_builder.py` for improved context assembly
   - Enhanced `document_parser.py` for document text extraction
   - Enhanced `text_utils.py` for action extraction from responses

## Documentation

Detailed documentation has been added in:
- `/docs/CHAT-API-DOCUMENTATION.md`

## Testing

To test the endpoint, run:
```bash
cd backend/scripts
./test_chat_api.sh
```

## Next Steps

The next task in the development plan is to implement the `/api/task/{taskId}/action` endpoint, which will allow users to trigger AI-recommended actions. This endpoint is already set up but may need enhancements to integrate with Azure Functions for action execution.

## Notes

- The OpenAI client has been updated to use the latest API format (AsyncOpenAI)
- For the prototype, document text extraction is simulated with predefined content
- In a production environment, real document parsing from Google Drive would be implemented
