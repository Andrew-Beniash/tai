   - Storage connectivity verification
   - Detailed error logging and HTTP status codes

## Testing

The function has been tested using the provided test script: `/functions/generateClientSummary/test_generate_summary.py`

Example test request:
```json
{
  "projectId": "001",
  "clientName": "Acme Corp",
  "summaryData": {
    "taxYear": 2024,
    "services": ["Corporate Tax Filing", "Tax Planning"],
    "keyFindings": ["All required tax forms are included"],
    "recommendations": ["Consider quarterly tax payments"],
    "financialHighlights": {

      "expenses": 850000,
      "netIncome": 400000,
      "taxLiability": 84000,
      "comparisonWithLastYear": {
        "revenueChange": 15.2,
        "expensesChange": 12.1,
        "netIncomeChange": 22.5,
        "taxLiabilityChange": -5.3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration with Overall System

This function completes the set of action functions that can be triggered from the frontend when users select AI-recommended actions. The client summary generator is a key component that demonstrates how the system can automatically generate professional documents from AI-analyzed data.

## Next Steps

1. Integration with the frontend action buttons
2. Full end-to-end testing of the complete prototype
3. User acceptance testing with the Jeff and Hanna personas

## Documentation

Detailed documentation has been added:
- Function README: `/functions/generateClientSummary/README.md`
- Test script: `/functions/generateClientSummary/test_generate_summary.py`
- Enhanced docstrings in the function code

## Hours Spent: 3
