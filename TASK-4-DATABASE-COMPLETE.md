# Task 4: Provision Azure Cosmos DB - Complete

## Summary of Work Completed

We have successfully set up the Azure Cosmos DB database structure and integration for the AI-Augmented Tax Engagement Prototype. This work addresses Task #4 from the Development Plan: "Provision Azure Cosmos DB or Table Storage - Set up a database to store user, project, task, and document metadata."

### 1. Cosmos DB Configuration

- Created a Cosmos DB client in `backend/app/core/cosmos_client.py`
- Updated the configuration in `backend/app/core/config.py` with Cosmos DB settings
- Created a generic repository pattern for database operations

### 2. Service Implementations

Created service classes for each model:
- `backend/app/services/database_service.py` - Base service with common operations
- `backend/app/services/user_service.py` - User management
- `backend/app/services/project_service.py` - Project management
- `backend/app/services/task_service.py` - Task management
- `backend/app/services/document_service.py` - Document metadata management

### 3. Application Initialization

- Updated `backend/app/main.py` to initialize services at startup
- Added code to create hardcoded users (Jeff and Hanna) if they don't exist

### 4. Deployment Scripts and Documentation

- Created deployment script `azure-deployment/deploy-cosmos-db.sh` to provision Cosmos DB resources
- Added comprehensive setup guide in `azure-deployment/COSMOS-DB-SETUP.md`
- Updated the backend README with database setup instructions

## Database Structure

The following containers are created in the Azure Cosmos DB database:

1. **users** - Stores user profiles
   - ID: User ID (e.g., "jeff", "hanna")
   - Name: User's full name
   - Role: "Preparer" or "Reviewer"
   - Password: (For prototype only - would be hashed in production)

2. **projects** - Stores project metadata
   - project_id: Unique project identifier
   - name: Project name
   - clients: List of client companies
   - services: List of tax services
   - documents: List of document IDs
   - tasks: List of task IDs

3. **tasks** - Stores task information
   - task_id: Unique task identifier
   - project_id: Associated project ID
   - assigned_to: User ID of assigned user
   - client: Client company name
   - tax_form: Tax form type (e.g., 1120, 1065)
   - documents: List of document IDs
   - status: Task status (e.g., "Not Started", "In Progress")
   - description: Task description
   - due_date: Due date in ISO format

4. **documents** - Stores document metadata
   - doc_id: Unique document identifier
   - file_name: Original file name
   - file_type: File type (e.g., pdf, docx, xlsx)
   - last_modified: Last modified timestamp
   - project_id: Associated project ID
   - drive_file_id: Google Drive file ID
   - description: Document description
   - size_bytes: File size in bytes
   - web_view_link: Web view link for the document

## How to Provision the Database

Three options are provided:
1. Using the Azure Portal (manual setup)
2. Using the deployment script (recommended)
3. Using the ARM template manually

Detailed instructions are available in `azure-deployment/COSMOS-DB-SETUP.md`.

## Next Steps

According to the Development Plan, the next tasks are:

5. **Setup Google Drive API Access**
   - Create Google Cloud project, configure service account, generate credentials, set folder structure.

6. **Initialize FastAPI Backend Project**
   - Bootstrap FastAPI application with basic folder structure, dependencies, server setup.

The database integration work completed here provides the foundation for these next steps, as the models and services are now ready to be used by the API endpoints.

## Notes for Developers

- The database client uses a generic repository pattern for easy extension
- ID fields are used as partition keys for optimal performance
- Services perform data validation using Pydantic models
- The application automatically initializes hardcoded users on startup
- Connection information is loaded from environment variables
