# Task #25: Embedded AI Chat UI Implementation

## Overview
The Embedded AI Chat UI has been successfully implemented and enhanced. The chat interface allows users to interact with the AI assistant, send messages, receive responses, and execute AI-suggested actions.

## Features
- **Real-time chat interface** for interacting with the AI assistant
- **Markdown support** for formatting AI responses (code blocks, lists, tables, etc.)
- **Preset questions** for quick access to common queries
- **Action execution** directly from chat messages
- **Error handling** for failed API requests
- **Loading indicators** for better user experience
- **Auto-resizing text input** field for comfortable message entry
- **Message timestamps** for tracking conversation flow
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Animated message transitions** for a polished user experience

## Implementation Details
The ChatWidget component has been implemented in `/frontend/src/components/ChatWidget.tsx` with the following functionality:

1. **Message display** - Shows user messages, AI responses, and system notifications in a scrollable chat interface
2. **Message input** - Allows typing and sending messages, with support for multi-line input
3. **Chat history** - Maintains conversation context for the current session
4. **Preset questions** - Displays a set of predefined questions for quick selection
5. **Action handling** - Renders action buttons within AI messages and processes user-selected actions
6. **Error handling** - Provides visual feedback for API errors and failed actions

## New Dependencies
Two new dependencies have been added to enhance the chat experience:
- `react-markdown` - Renders markdown content in AI messages
- `@tailwindcss/typography` - Provides styling for markdown elements

## Tailwind Configuration Updates
The Tailwind configuration file has been updated to add:
- Support for typography plugin (for markdown formatting)
- Custom animation keyframes for message transitions

## Integration
The ChatWidget is integrated into the TaskDetailPage component, where it occupies two-thirds of the screen on larger devices. The component receives the current task ID as a prop to ensure all chat interactions are contextualized to the specific task.

## Testing Instructions
1. Install new dependencies using the provided script:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ./install-dependencies.sh
   ```

2. Run the frontend application with `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to any task detail page
4. Try sending messages to the AI assistant
5. Test preset questions by clicking on them
6. Verify that AI responses are properly formatted with markdown
7. Test action buttons when suggested by the AI
8. Verify error messages appear when appropriate
9. Test resizing behavior of the text input

## Troubleshooting CSS Issues
If you encounter any CSS parsing errors (like `Unexpected token, expected ";"` in the index.css file), try the following:

1. Ensure the Tailwind configuration file has been properly updated with the animation keyframes
2. Rebuild the application with `npm run build`
3. Restart the development server with `npm run dev`

## Notes
- The AI assistant can access task-related documents and metadata through the backend API
- The backend API handles document retrieval and AI prompting to provide contextual responses
- The component is designed to work with the existing API endpoints without requiring changes to the backend
