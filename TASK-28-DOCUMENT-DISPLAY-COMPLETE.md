## Testing Instructions

1. Log in as either Jeff or Hanna
2. Navigate to a project from the Projects list
3. Click on the "Documents" link for a project
4. View the list of documents for the project
5. Click "View" to preview a document
6. Click "Download" to download a document
7. Try the "Sync with Google Drive" button to refresh the document list

- For other file types, users are directed to download the file or open it in Google Drive
- The sync operation refreshes document metadata from Google Drive without needing to reload the page
