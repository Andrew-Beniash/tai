# Task 10: Implement /api/tasks Endpoint - COMPLETE

## Summary
The `/api/tasks` endpoint has been successfully implemented with the following features:

- List tasks filtered by the current logged-in user
- Optionally filter tasks by project ID
- Get a specific task by ID
- Create new tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Get all tasks for a specific project

## Implementation Details

1. **Task Service Updates**:
   - Added `get_tasks_by_user` method that accepts an optional `project_id` parameter
   - Implemented `get_tasks_by_project_and_user` method to combine filtering
   - Added `get_task_by_id` method for retrieving a specific task
   - Added `delete_task` method for removing tasks
   - Implemented `initialize_sample_tasks` method to populate the database with example tasks

2. **API Endpoint Implementation**:
   - Created REST endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks
   - Added parameter to filter tasks by the user and project
   - Implemented proper authentication using the `get_current_user` dependency
   - Added error handling for cases like not found tasks

3. **Sample Data**:
   - Added sample tasks for demo purposes
   - Created tasks assigned to both Jeff (Preparer) and Hanna (Reviewer)
   - Associated tasks with the existing sample projects

## Next Steps
The `/api/tasks` endpoint is now ready for integration with the frontend. The next task in the development plan is:

- Implement `/api/task/{taskId}` Endpoint: This is already covered by the current implementation
- Implement `/api/task/{taskId}/chat` Endpoint: For accepting user questions and calling OpenAI API with contextual data
