# Task 15: RAG Context Assembly Logic - Complete

## Task Summary
Successfully implemented the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Context Assembly Logic for the AI Tax Engagement Prototype. This implementation enables the system to load document snippets, task metadata, and inject them into AI prompts before sending to OpenAI.

## Implementation Details

### Components Enhanced:

1. **RAG Service** (`app/services/rag_service.py`)
   - Implemented comprehensive context assembly with document retrieval
   - Added query-guided document snippet extraction
   - Created advanced document search functionality
   - Added tax-specific query expansion
   - Implemented prompt building with assembled context

2. **Text Utilities** (`app/utils/text_utils.py`)
   - Added document chunking functionality for better context processing
   - Implemented keyword extraction for improved relevance
   - Created relevance scoring between text and queries
   - Added tax-specific entity extraction
   - Implemented document simplification for context efficiency

3. **Prompt Builder** (`app/utils/prompt_builder.py`)
   - Enhanced prompt construction to incorporate RAG context
   - Improved document context formatting for AI consumption
   - Added support for tax form templates in prompts
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for reliability

4. **AI Service** (`app/services/ai_service.py`)
   - Updated message processing to utilize enhanced RAG context
   - Improved document analysis with RAG-based context
   - Added contextual awareness for better AI responses

### Additional Files Created:

1. **RAG Testing Tool** (`app/utils/rag_test.py`)
   - Created a testing script to validate RAG implementation
   - Includes tests for context assembly, document chunking, and relevance scoring

2. **Documentation** (`docs/RAG_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY.md`)
   - Comprehensive documentation of the RAG Context Assembly implementation
   - Includes design details, code examples, and best practices

## Key Features Implemented:

1. **Query-Aware Document Retrieval**
   - Documents are retrieved and prioritized based on relevance to user queries
   - Appropriate sections of documents are extracted to provide focused context

2. **Tax-Specific Term Expansion**
   - User queries are expanded with tax-related terminology for more comprehensive retrieval
   - Domain-specific knowledge is leveraged to improve document relevance

3. **Intelligent Context Assembly**
   - Task metadata, project information, and document snippets are combined for rich context
   - Token limits are managed while preserving the most relevant information

4. **Document References in Prompts**
   - Document sources are included in prompts to enable attribution in AI responses
   - File names and types are preserved for better context understanding

5. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - System includes fallback mechanisms if document retrieval or context assembly fails
   - Legacy prompt building is preserved as a backup option

## Testing Information:

The implementation was tested using the `rag_test.py` script, which validates:
- Task context extraction
- Prompt building with RAG context
- Document chunking and processing
- Context relevance scoring

## Next Steps:

This implementation completes Task 15 according to the development plan. The next tasks can now build upon this foundation:

- **Task 16**: Generate Missing Information Letter (Azure Function)
- **Task 17**: Trigger Risk Review API (Azure Function)

The enhanced RAG Context Assembly Logic will provide these functions with better context for their operations.
