# Task 14: Google Drive Document Fetching - Summary

## Implementation Overview

This task implements the Google Drive document fetching functionality for the AI Tax Engagement Prototype, allowing the system to retrieve, process, and integrate documents with the AI chat service.

### Objective

The core objective was to create a backend service that can:
1. List and fetch documents from Google Drive based on project/task associations
2. Extract text content from various document types
3. Integrate document context into AI prompts
4. Provide API endpoints for document management

### Key Components Implemented

1. **Enhanced Document Service**
   - Added methods to sync documents from Google Drive
   - Implemented content fetching in various formats (raw, base64, text)
   - Created document upload functionality
   - Improved metadata management

2. **Document Parser Utilities**
   - Added support for extracting text from PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and text files
   - Implemented document preview generation
   - Created contextual extraction based on queries

3. **New API Endpoints**
   - Created dedicated document API endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Implemented document download/upload functionality
   - Added document content extraction endpoints
   - Created sync endpoints to refresh from Google Drive

4. **AI Integration Enhancements**
   - Updated prompt builder to include document context
   - Implemented RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) context assembly
   - Enhanced AI service to work with document content
   - Improved chat API to incorporate document context

5. **Dependency Management**
   - Added necessary libraries for document parsing (PyPDF2, python-docx, pandas)

### Files Modified/Created

1. **Modified Files:**
   - `app/services/document_service.py` - Enhanced with Google Drive integration
   - `app/utils/document_parser.py` - Updated for document text extraction
   - `app/utils/prompt_builder.py` - Enhanced for document context in prompts
   - `app/services/ai_service.py` - Updated to work with document content
   - `app/main.py` - Updated to include document router
   - `app/api/chat.py` - Enhanced with document context functionality
   - `requirements.txt` - Added document parsing dependencies

2. **Created Files:**
   - `app/api/documents.py` - New API endpoints for document operations
   - `TASK-14-DOCUMENT-FETCHING-COMPLETE.md` - Documentation
   - `TASK-14-TESTING-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Testing guide
   - `TASK-14-SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary

### Key Features

1. **Document Synchronization**
   - Automatic sync of documents between Google Drive and database
   - Metadata tracking for documents (file type, size, modified date)
   - Association with projects and tasks

2. **Content Extraction**
   - Text extraction from multiple document formats
   - Keyword-based relevant content extraction
   - Format conversion (raw bytes, base64, text)

3. **AI Context Integration**
   - Document content incorporation into AI prompts
   - Selective extraction of relevant document sections
   - Document references in AI responses

4. **Task-Document Relationships**
   - Association of documents with tasks
   - Filtering documents by project or task
   - Synchronization of document metadata

### Technical Details

1. **Google Drive Integration**
   - Uses the existing drive_client.py for Google Drive operations
   - Implements folder-based project document organization
   - Handles file content download and upload

2. **Document Parsing**
   - Conditional imports for document parsing libraries
   - Format-specific text extraction methods
   - Error handling for unsupported formats

3. **RAG Implementation**
   - Extracts relevant document sections based on query
   - Limits context size to avoid token limits
   - Prioritizes most relevant documents

4. **API Design**
   - RESTful endpoints for document operations
   - Query parameters for different content formats
   - Error handling for missing documents or parsing issues

### Testing Approach

Comprehensive testing instructions have been provided in `TASK-14-TESTING-INSTRUCTIONS.md` covering:
1. Document synchronization testing
2. Content retrieval and extraction testing
3. Document-task association testing
4. Integration with AI chat testing
5. Error handling and edge case testing

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully meets the requirements for Google Drive document fetching and integration with the AI Tax Engagement Prototype. The system can now retrieve, process, and incorporate document content into AI interactions, providing a more context-aware and helpful assistant for tax professionals.

The modular design allows for future enhancements such as more sophisticated document parsing, improved keyword extraction, and enhanced AI prompt construction.
