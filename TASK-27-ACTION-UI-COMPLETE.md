# AI-Suggested Actions in UI Implementation

## Overview

This task involved enhancing the UI components to handle AI-recommended actions. The implementation now allows the AI assistant to suggest actions based on its analysis of the conversation, and users can execute these actions directly from either the chat interface or a dedicated action panel.

## Implementation Details

### Components Updated:

1. **ChatWidget.tsx**
   - Added support for displaying suggested actions within AI message bubbles
   - Implemented proper loading states during action execution
   - Added callback to notify parent components when an action is suggested
   - Enhanced styling of action buttons for better visibility
   - Improved error handling and user feedback for action execution

2. **ActionButtons.tsx**
   - Updated to dynamically fetch and display available actions
   - Improved styling and user feedback
   - Added proper loading states and error handling
   - Enhanced the action execution callback to include results

3. **TaskDetailPage.tsx**
   - Integrated the ChatWidget and ActionButtons components
   - Added state management for suggested actions
   - Implemented handlers for action suggestions and completions

### New Components Created:

1. **useActions.ts** (Custom Hook)
   - Created a custom React hook to manage actions state and logic
   - Provides functions for executing actions and managing their state
   - Centralizes action-related functionality for reuse across components

## Features Implemented:

1. **Inline Action Suggestions**: AI can suggest relevant actions directly in chat responses.

2. **Dedicated Action Panel**: A separate panel appears when an action is suggested, providing more context about the action.

3. **Action Execution Feedback**: Clear visual feedback when actions are executed, including success/failure status and generated document links.

4. **Error Handling**: Proper error states and user-friendly messages when actions fail.

5. **Loading States**: Visual indicators during action execution to prevent duplicate submissions.

## Testing Instructions:

1. Log in as either Jeff or Hanna.
2. Navigate to a task detail page.
3. Ask questions that would likely trigger action suggestions:
   - "What information is missing from this filing?"
   - "Can you analyze the risk factors for this client?"
   - "Could you prepare a summary of this project?"

4. When an action is suggested:
   - Verify that the action button appears in the AI response
   - Check that the standalone action panel also appears with the same action
   - Execute the action using either button
   - Verify proper loading states during execution
   - Confirm success/failure feedback is displayed
   - If a document is generated, verify the link works

5. Check error handling:
   - Try executing an action twice
   - Verify proper error messaging if the action fails

## Next Steps:

- Consider adding parameter input for actions that require additional configuration
- Add support for multiple suggested actions in a single AI response
- Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive or resource-intensive actions
- Add action history for reviewing previously executed actions
