This is a placeholder for a Word template (docx) file.

In a real implementation, this would be a properly formatted .docx template with the following structure:

-----------------------------------------------------

Since we can't create a binary .docx file directly here, you'll need to create a proper Word template with these placeholders and save it as 'client_summary_template.docx' in this directory.

For the docxtpl library to work, the placeholders should be in the format {{ variable_name }} and the for loops in the format {% for item in items %}...{% endfor %}.
