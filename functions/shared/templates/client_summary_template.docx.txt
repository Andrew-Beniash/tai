This is a placeholder for a Word template (docx) file.

In a real implementation, this would be a properly formatted .docx template with placeholders for:

- Client name: {{ client_name }}
- Project ID: {{ project_id }}
- Date: {{ date }}
- Prepared by: {{ prepared_by }}
- Tax year: {{ tax_year }}
- Services: {{ services }}
- Key findings: {{ key_findings }}
- Recommendations: {{ recommendations }}
- Financial highlights: {{ financial_highlights }}

Since we can't create a binary .docx file directly here, you'll need to create a proper Word template with these placeholders and save it as 'client_summary_template.docx' in this directory.

For the docxtpl library to work, the placeholders should be in the format {{ variable_name }}.
