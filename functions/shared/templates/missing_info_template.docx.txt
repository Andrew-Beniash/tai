This is a placeholder for a Word template (docx) file.

In a real implementation, this would be a properly formatted .docx template with placeholders for:

- Client name: {{ client_name }}
- Date: {{ date }}
- Task ID: {{ task_id }}
- Missing items: {{ missing_items }}
- Preparer name: {{ preparer_name }}

Since we can't create a binary .docx file directly here, you'll need to create a proper Word template with these placeholders and save it as 'missing_info_template.docx' in this directory.

For the docxtpl library to work, the placeholders should be in the format {{ variable_name }}.
