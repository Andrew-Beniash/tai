## Technical Details

- All components are implemented using React with TypeScript for type safety
- Used TailwindCSS for styling and responsive design

- Added loading states and error handling throughout the UI

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to the application in your browser (typically at `http://localhost:5173`)

4. Login with one of the sample users (jeff or hanna)

5. Navigate to a project and select a task to view the task detail screen

6. Test the following functionality:
   - Viewing task details and associated documents
   - Interacting with the AI chat interface
   - Sending messages and viewing responses
   - Using preset questions
   - Executing AI-suggested actions

## Notes

- The document viewing functionality requires proper Google Drive integration
- The AI chat functionality depends on the backend API endpoints being properly configured
- The layout is responsive and should work well on both desktop and mobile devices
